# Language-Detection

## Overview
This project aims to implement a language detection system using machine learning techniques. The system will be capable of identifying the language of a given text input.

## Model Selection
Several machine learning algorithms can be employed for language detection, including:
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks

The choice of model will depend on factors such as dataset size, feature representation, and computational resources.

## Evaluation
The performance of the language detection model will be assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques will be employed to ensure the generalization of the model.
